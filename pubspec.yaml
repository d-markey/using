description: This package provides a `Releasable` mixin to upgrade any class with automatic cleanup and finalization features, similar to C#'s `IDisposable` and Java's `AutoCloseable`. Extension methods enhance the development experience with constructs close to `using` in C# and `try-with-resource` in Java.
